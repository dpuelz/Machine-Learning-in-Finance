# Machine Learning in Finance 
PhD-level class at the University of Texas at Austin, Spring 2022

The structure of this class is simple.  We will have periodic lectures to cover topics in ML, and (crucially) we will spend time discussing new papers in the field.  You can find the syllabus [here](course_outline.pdf).
