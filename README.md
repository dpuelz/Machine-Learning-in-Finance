# Machine Learning in Finance 
PhD class at the University of Texas at Austin, Spring 2022

The structure of this class is simple.  First, we will read [Machine Learning in Asset Pricing](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691218700/machine-learning-in-asset-pricing) (MLAP).  During the first half of each class, students will present and lead a discussion of the required MLAP reading.  During the second half of class, students will present and lead a discussion of 1-2 academic papers.  An initial collection of papers is given below. As needed, we will have periodic lectures to cover topics in ML that appear.
